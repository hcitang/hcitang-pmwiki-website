* **Learning through Video.** Design and run an interview study of how and what kinds of things people learn through YouTube.
* **Crowdsourced Video Annotation.** Building a highlight reel for a sports game by simply examining the twitter feed for cues as to when interesting events occurred.
* **Tangible Video Cuts.** Using a tracked "magic lens" into a video cube over a table, producing cuts into the video.
* **Crowd-sourced Bots for Games.** Using crowd-sourced data (multiple plays of a game), is it possible to build bots for games?
* **Edge Lens/Bundling in Parallel Coordinates.** Parallel coordinates start to get unwieldy when there are a lot of lines (data points). Can they be made more usable through interactive edge lens/plucking or edge bundling? Design and build a system to explore this question. Potentially, explore multi-point interaction for this.
