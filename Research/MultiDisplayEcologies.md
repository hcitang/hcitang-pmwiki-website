## Proximity-Aware Toolkit for Pico-projectors

We are building a toolkit to support programming pico-projectors where their position and orientation is tracked.

## Gestures for Multi-Display Environments

We are building and evaluating a set of gestures that can be used to move information around a multi-display environment, comprised of mobile personal displays and fixed shared displays.

## Design Strategies for Proximity-Aware Environments

We are evaluating different kinds of strategies for designing gestures in MDEs where proxemics are taken into account.
