I am interested in supervising and advising CPSC 502/503 undergrad research projects. Please contact me directly if you are interested.

* **Mobile Camera Work.** Explore methods for supporting video conferencing using mobile devices (fixed, multiple displays, etc.)
* **Unintended Uses of Games.** Design and run a study that explores unintended uses of tools/games. Might follow on from the sustainability angle, but the games angle is an interesting one to follow through on here.
* **Sandbox Games.** Design and run a study that explores the different uses of sandbox games. Articulate new design requirements for games that aim to provide sandbox-like capabilities.
* **Personal Visualizations.** Visualization of personal information for seeking out patterns and supporting reflection/understanding. Potential areas of interest: photo data, personal orientation data, etc.
* **Mobile device use in the Home.** Domestic use of mobile devices is considerably different than the way mobile devices were expected to be used even 10 years ago. Design and run a diary study of how mobile devices are used in the domestic context.
* Something you suggest...
