### Collaborative Interaction in Display Ecologies

Teams use shared surfaces like whiteboards and tables for presentations, discussion and problem solving. These environments will soon become digital workrooms, which are display ecologies comprised of both shared displays like interactive walls and tabletops, and personal displays, like tablets, laptops and PDAs. My work investigates interaction techniques for devices in these ecologies to support interaction between displays, devices, and people.

### Media Spaces for Remote Interaction

Many teams and individuals work at a distance from one another. What kinds of tools do we need to provide people so that they can work effectively with remote collaborators? I have explored this question by varying the size of the collaborating teams, as well as exploring this question from the perspective of large displays.

### Collaboration and Games

People exhibit all sorts of interesting behaviours in games that we can learn from for design. This is one of the more interesting spaces of research, given the ubiquity of games, and the possibility of pervasive games.

### Visualization

Visualization provides us with brand new ways of understanding and interpreting data. Exploring this affordance in the context rich data is something I enjoy doing.

## Home Networking Data Recorder

We are currently collecting network data from several home networks, analyzing this data, and trying to understand what we can gather from summaries of collected data. Part of this involves building visualizations to help understand the data. One way to make use of this data is to see how it can be used as a mechanism to infer information or patterns about the users and devices in the household.

## [Coordination in Distributed Gaming](FPSCoordination.md)

FPS teams communicate and coordinate their activities primarily using the audio channel. We are interested in understanding how they do so, and what we can learn from their techniques.

## [Visualising Tabletop Collaboration](VisTACO.md)

Using visualizations to aid us in analysis of tabletop collaboration.

## Cross-Reality Collaboration

How do you support collaboration between individuals and groups where some groups are in an instrumented, augmented interactive room? We are currently exploring the role of CVEs in supporting this style of collaboration. (w/ [Derek Reilly](http://www.cs.dal.ca/~reilly/), [Andy Wu](http://www.theauk.net/), Hafez Rouzati)
