# <a name="toc1" id="toc1"></a>1.  Introduction

The project will be an important and significant item in the class. It is expected that students devise and complete a project either on their own, or as paired with another student. There are several types of projects which will be acceptable (each idea will need to be discussed and approved by the instructor), though preference will be given to projects that either integrate aspects of the student's ongoing research in a new direction. Acceptable types of projects include, but are not limited to:

* Design of a novel groupware system
* Evaluation of a system with a focus on communication/coordination systems
* Qualitative investigation of an existing set of practices regarding communication/coordination

The main deliverables for the project will be: a proposal document that outlines a topic, research question of interest, and a plan for conducting that work (15%); a short 'mad-minute' presentation given to the class that summarizes the plan for this project (5%); a relevant literature review (5%), and a final paper written in CSCW format (40%).

Sample project areas:

* Audio media spaces
* Mobile audio media spaces
* Mobile, portable video media spaces
* Communication and coordination in first person shooter games
* Communication practices of health proxies

# <a name="toc2" id="toc2"></a>2.  Deliverables

* February 10, **Draft Project Proposal** (~1 page): This one-page proposal outlines a potential research question that you are interested in investigating. It potentially lays out the motivation for the work, and some potential objectives.
* February 24, **Detailed Project Proposal** (~3 - 6 pages): This is your formal project proposal, and _it is a contract._ It lays out the motivation for your work, the objectives, and the research question you are addressing. It spells out the milestones, a schedule for the work you'll deliver, and your deliverables. (I would recommend having a deliverable of some sort _every two weeks._ This helps us to keep our expectations (yours and mine) in sync.
* Week of March 1st, **"Mad Minute" presentations**: 5 minute talk to the class about what your current plan is, and any things you're not certain about + 5 minute discussion w/ class about your topic. This is a forum for you to present your ideas, and to get feedback from your classmates.
* March 17, **Literature Survey** (~3-6 pages): A summary of literature that is relevant to your research question of interest. This should be in the form of a "related work" section of a typical research paper. It can later be used for your final project report.
* Week of March 29, **Check-point meeting with me**: This is not mandatory, but it is recommended you check in with me about the status of your project at this point.
* Last week of class, **Conference-style presentation**: 15 minute talk + 5 minutes for questions
* Last day of class, **Project report 8-10 pages in [ACM CHI format](http://www.sigchi.org/chipubform)**
* Last day of class, **Archive of your materials/software**
