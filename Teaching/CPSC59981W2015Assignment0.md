We will focus on the use of node.js for the assignments in this class.

This particular assignment is a "completion" based assignment where the goal is simply to complete tutorials covering basic javascript and node.js principles.

* [Node.js Non-Tutorial](Teaching/nodejsnon-tutorial.pdf) ([md source](Teaching/nodejsnon-tutorial.md) | [html](Teaching/nodejsnon-tutorial.html)) - This is a "non-tutorial" that makes extensive use of external resources. By the end, you should be able to write basic Javascript code, have node.js installed, and understand the basics of network code.

# Deliverable

Send Tony two screenshots of your terminal showing that you completed each exercise for both the **javascripting** and **learnyounode** tutorials.

# Resources

* [Node.js tools for Visual Studio](https://nodejstools.codeplex.com/)
* [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) - a free telnet client that works in a way. If you're working on Windows, I suggest using this.
