# Project Proposal

Your proposal is your opportunity to articulate four things: (a) what the problem is, (b) what others have done about the problem, (c) what you will do about the problem, and to demonstrate that (d) you have a plan to address the problem. The proposal itself is a two-three page document. Your goal is to write it in such a way that demonstrates to the reader (i.e. me) that you are capable of carrying out the research plan, and that you know why you are carrying out the plan that you are.

## Template
