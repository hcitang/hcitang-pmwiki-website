Deliverables for Project Component

# Concept

Play is a central part of human experience -- not just in a "game" form, but in our everyday interactions. When you make a joke, or play a prank on your friends... these are different forms of play. We are interested in play as a concept in this class because many kinds of play are affected by technology -- if technology is not designed right, then play devolves into something less interesting, or it does not allow for the right kinds of play. For example, Parten provides a typology of different kinds of play. If the system is laggy, it precludes certain types of interaction (and therefore, certain types of play).

Your project should involve some kind of play, or multiple types of play. There are two fundamental types of projects for this course: study and design. A study project involves examining one context of play, and understanding it -- this means conducting user research to understand the nature of play in that context. This type of project would generally involve exploring a particular type of game and how it is played. A design project involves actually designing or building a simple game. Here, I am looking for you to explore how to design to support a deep, meaningful type of play beyond parallel play. In Parten's terms, I am looking for actual cooperative play.

Deliverables for this project include: (a) a project proposal (due about 1/3 of the way through the term); (b) a midterm project presentation (due around the middle of the term); (c) a final project presentation (due at the end of the term), and (d) a final project paper (due at the last class). If there are materials (code, data, etc.), these should be handed in with the project paper.

# Deliverables

* Project proposal
* Midterm presentation (changed this into a set of speed dating activities)
* Final project presentation
* Final project paper

# Final Project Presentation

**Coverage (study):** For a study project, I expect you to describe the following: (a) what you are studying; (b) why you are studying it; (c) describe the basics of your study; (d) describe your findings (what you saw) with evidence (e.g. sample quotes, captured video, etc.), and (e) what your findings tell us (in terms of telling us how to design for play).
**Coverage (design):** For a design project, I expect you to discuss the following: (a) what is your game; (b) a quick gameplay video with core mechanics discussed, (c) what are the design principles that underlie some of mechanics/what are your goals for gameplay; (d) design evolution -- how did your game change from its original scope, and (e) what does your game tell us about designing for play?
**Length:** Your presentation will be 12 minutes. You will be expected to answer questions about your work for about 3 minutes.
**Instructions:** Prepare your slide deck in PowerPoint. Post it to Piazza under the appropriate thread the evening before your scheduled presentation date (by 11:59pm) so that Tony can have it ready on his laptop for the morning of.
**Evaluation:** You will be evaluated on your ability to concisely document your project, method, and results. Your presentation will be graded on your ability to present the project in an engaging and entertaining fashion. You will be critiqued on both the content of the presentation and your delivery.

# Final Project Paper

**Instructions:** In all cases, you should use the [following template](http://chi2013.acm.org/authors/format/#extendedformat) (extended abstract format) to prepare your paper. It should be handed in on the last day of class in physical form (i.e. printed on paper).
**Length:** Your paper should be no more than six pages long.
**Evaluation:** You will be evaluated on your ability to concisely document your project, method, and results. You will also be graded on your writing ability. 

1. Study Project

Include in an appendix (digital or physical): data that you collected (e.g. transcripts, audio/video recordings, etc.)

Your paper should have four sections:

<dl><dd>

* Introduction (a & b)
* Method (c)
* Results/Findings (d)
* Discussion & Conclusion (e)</dd></dl>

Note: the a-e designations follow the major sections of your presentation.

Include, where appropriate, explicit quotations from your participants, data about the participants (e.g. bar charts, etc.), or pictures if appropriate.

2. Design Project

Include as a digital appendix: a video of your game, or people playing your game.

Your paper should have five sections:

<dl><dd>

* Introduction (a & b)
* Design principles (c)
* Implementation details
* Design evolution (d)
* Discussion & Conclusion (e)</dd></dl>

# Final Note

While your presentation and project paper have similar sections, you will want to emphasize different sections depending on what medium you are working in. For example, if you are doing a presentation, you want to spend most of your time on findings, or gameplay ideas.
