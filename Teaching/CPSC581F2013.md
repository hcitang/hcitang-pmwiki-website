## CPSC 581: Human Computer Interaction II  (Fall, 2013)

This second undergraduate course in Human Computer Interaction concentrates on having students acquire skills in creative aspects of Interaction Design. It is an unusual course for computer science as it somewhat follows the structure of a design studio: students mostly learn by doing vs. listening to lectures.

### Course description

Advanced topics and applications in human computer interaction, with emphasis on developing skills for designing highly interactive human-computer interfaces.

### Prerequisites

Computer Science 481, and Permission of the instructor

### Class Time

Classes and labs are scheduled contiguously: you are expected to attend both.

Fall, 2013: Monday, Wednesday 10:00 - 12:15
