There are three assignments, worth a total of 10 points. Assignment A0 is your bonus assignment.

Assignments are to be completed **individually.** You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing. These are all (essentially) written assignments. *Note: if you talk with a classmate about the assignments, you need to list them in an Acknowledgements section of your paper*
