Add the following as a bookmarklet (for Chrome):

<div style="white-space: pre; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #888;"> 

javascript:void(location.href='[http://ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/login?url=](http://ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/login?url=)'+location.href)

</div>

When you navigate to a page that needs a subscription (e.g. ACM DL, IEEE, Springer, etc.), just click the bookmarklet, login with your UCalgary credentials, and you'll be able to download any PDF that our university has a subscription for.
