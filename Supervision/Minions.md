If you or anyone you know would like to embark on an exciting career in research, would just like to have a taste of what it would be like to be a minion, or want to get involved in world domination, please get in touch with me! I am looking for both undergrad researchers, and MSc candidates. Take a look at the [Undergrad Research Projects](Research/UndergradResearchProjects.md) that are available (or propose one), or take a gander at some of the [Current Projects](Research/CurrentProjects.md) underway in my group, or some of the [Past Projects](Research/PastProjects.md) to get a sense for what we do.

If these things seem interesting, feel free to fire me an email. Include the following ([I will not review anything without all four items](http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp))::

1.  A good knock knock joke

2.  Unofficial transcript

3.  Resume

4.  Sample of writing (e.g. an essay you wrote)
