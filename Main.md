e: tonyt @ ucalgary.ca 
o: Math Sciences 680B</td><td>I am an Associate Professor (as of July 1, 2016) in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) at the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca/). I direct the [RICELab](http://ricelab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) research group.

My research interests are situated in [Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_supported_cooperative_work) -- the study of how people work together using technology -- with a twist of [Ubiquitous Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) -- technology in everyday scenarios. My current research investigates the integration of mobile devices in large display environments, exploration into personal informatics, and telecommunication technologies for collaborative work.

I am a proud member of the [Extremely Tall and Extremely Short HCI Researchers Club](http://www.elainehuang.com/tallshort.html). If you haven't met me, I am a very _very_ tall guy. Really.
